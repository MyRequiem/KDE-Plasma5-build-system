# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

kimap: kimap (API for the handling of IMAP data)
kimap:
kimap: This library provides a job-based API for interacting with an IMAP4rev1
kimap: server. It manages connections, encryption and parameter quoting and
kimap: encoding, but otherwise provides quite a low-level interface to the
kimap: protocol. This library does not implement an IMAP client, it merely
kimap: makes it easier to do so.
