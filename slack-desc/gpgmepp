# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gpgmepp: gpgmepp (C++ bindings/wrapper for gpgme)
gpgmepp:
gpgmepp: GpgME++ is a C++ wrapper (or C++ bindings) for the GnuPG project's
gpgmepp: gpgme (GnuPG Made Easy) library, version 0.4.4 and later.
gpgmepp: It is fairly complete, with some minor things still missing
gpgmepp: (in particular, the key edit interface). It is mostly tested using
gpgmepp: external event loops, for which its design is optimised.
