# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lmdb: lmdb (lightning memory-mapped database)
lmdb:
lmdb: LMDB is an ultra-fast, ultra-compact key-value embedded data store. By
lmdb: using memory-mapped files, it provides the read performance of a pure
lmdb: in-memory database while still offering the persistence of standard
lmdb: disk-based databases, and is only limited to the size of the virtual
lmdb: address space.
